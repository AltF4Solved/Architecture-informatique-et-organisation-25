The address of the TMP102 is configurable via the ADD0 pin. On the PCB, this
pin is connected to GND. Determine the real address and the derived read and
write addresses (in hexadecimal).
Answer:


Derived Read and Write Addresses

I²C uses 8-bit addresses for transactions:

    Write Address: (0x48 << 1) | 0 = 0x90
    Read Address: (0x48 << 1) | 1 = 0x91

Final Answer:

    7-bit Address: 0x48
    Write Address (8-bit): 0x90
    Read Address (8-bit): 0x91


y default, the TMP102 uses a 12-bit format to represent the temperature. Using
this 12-bit format, what will be the representation of -12◦C and 30◦C?
Answer:

The TMP102 temperature sensor uses a 12-bit two's complement format to represent temperature. The MSB (most significant bit) is the sign bit, where:

    0 = Positive temperature
    1 = Negative temperature

The temperature is stored in bits [11:0], with a resolution of 0.0625°C per bit.
Step 1: Convert 30°C to 12-bit Format

    Convert to binary
        30°C÷0.0625°C30°C÷0.0625°C = 480 (decimal)
        Binary: 0001 1110 0000 (12-bit)

    Final 12-bit representation
        0001 1110 0000 (Hex: 0x1E0)

Step 2: Convert -12°C to 12-bit Format

    Convert absolute value to binary
        12°C÷0.0625°C12°C÷0.0625°C = 192 (decimal)
        Binary: 0000 1100 0000 (12-bit unsigned)

    Convert to two's complement
        Invert: 1111 0011 1111
        Add 1: 1111 0100 0000

    Final 12-bit representation
        1111 0100 0000 (Hex: 0xF40)

Final Answer:

    30°C in 12-bit format: 0001 1110 0000 (Hex: 0x1E0)
    -12°C in 12-bit format: 1111 0100 0000 (Hex: 0xF40)
