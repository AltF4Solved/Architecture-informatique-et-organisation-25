The address of the TMP102 is configurable via the ADD0 pin. On the PCB, this
pin is connected to GND. Determine the real address and the derived read and
write addresses (in hexadecimal).
Answer:


Derived Read and Write Addresses

I²C uses 8-bit addresses for transactions:

    Write Address: (0x48 << 1) | 0 = 0x90
    Read Address: (0x48 << 1) | 1 = 0x91

Final Answer:

    7-bit Address: 0x48
    Write Address (8-bit): 0x90
    Read Address (8-bit): 0x91

y default, the TMP102 uses a 12-bit format to represent the temperature. Using
this 12-bit format, what will be the representation of -12◦C and 30◦C?
Answer:

The TMP102 temperature sensor uses a 12-bit two's complement format to represent temperature. The MSB (most significant bit) is the sign bit, where:

    0 = Positive temperature
    1 = Negative temperature

The temperature is stored in bits [11:0], with a resolution of 0.0625°C per bit.
Step 1: Convert 30°C to 12-bit Format

    Convert to binary
        30°C÷0.0625°C30°C÷0.0625°C = 480 (decimal)
        Binary: 0001 1110 0000 (12-bit)

    Final 12-bit representation
        0001 1110 0000 (Hex: 0x1E0)

Step 2: Convert -12°C to 12-bit Format

    Convert absolute value to binary
        12°C÷0.0625°C12°C÷0.0625°C = 192 (decimal)
        Binary: 0000 1100 0000 (12-bit unsigned)

    Convert to two's complement
        Invert: 1111 0011 1111
        Add 1: 1111 0100 0000

    Final 12-bit representation
        1111 0100 0000 (Hex: 0xF40)

Final Answer:

    30°C in 12-bit format: 0001 1110 0000 (Hex: 0x1E0)
    -12°C in 12-bit format: 1111 0100 0000 (Hex: 0xF40)

n the default 12-bit format, which temperatures are represented by the numbers
0010 1010 1001 and 1101 0100 1000?
Answer:

The TMP102 temperature sensor uses a 12-bit two's complement format, where:

    Bit 11 (MSB) is the sign bit:
        0 → Positive temperature
        1 → Negative temperature
    Bits [10:0] store the magnitude
    Each bit step represents 0.0625°C

Step 1: Decode 0010 1010 1001

    Binary: 0010 1010 1001
    Convert to decimal (since MSB is 0, it's positive)
        0010 1010 1001 (binary) = 681 (decimal)
    Convert to temperature:
        681×0.0625681×0.0625
        42.56°C

Final Answer: 42.56°C
Step 2: Decode 1101 0100 1000

    Binary: 1101 0100 1000
    Since MSB is 1, it's a negative temperature (two's complement).
        Invert bits: 0010 1011 0111
        Add 1: 0010 1011 1000
        0010 1011 1000 (binary) = 696 (decimal)
    Convert to temperature:
        696×0.0625=43.5696×0.0625=43.5
        Apply negative sign: -43.5°C

Final Answer: -43.5°C

How many bits of the 12-bit result are sufficient to represent the temperature
truncated to whole numbers?
Answer:

The TMP102 temperature sensor uses a 12-bit two’s complement format, where each bit represents 0.0625°C.
Step 1: Determine the Required Precision

    Whole numbers (°C) mean we don’t need the fractional part.
    The least significant 4 bits (bits [3:0]) represent fractional values:
        Bit 3 → 0.5°C
        Bit 2 → 0.25°C
        Bit 1 → 0.125°C
        Bit 0 → 0.0625°C
    These lower 4 bits can be discarded when rounding to whole numbers.

Step 2: Identify the Necessary Bits

    Bits [11:4] contain the whole number part (sign + integer value).
    Only 8 bits (bits [11:4]) are required to represent temperatures as whole numbers.

Final Answer:

    8 bits (bits [11:4]) are sufficient to represent whole-number temperatures.
