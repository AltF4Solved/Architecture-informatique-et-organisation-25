What line of code would you use to clear the I2C interrupt flag?

Lines where SI is cleared:

    Line inside case 0x08 (Start condition sent)

LPC_I2C->CONCLR = (1<<3) | (1<<5);

    Clears SI (1<<3) and Start condition flag (1<<5).

Line inside case 0x18 (Slave address + write ACK received)

LPC_I2C->CONCLR = (1<<3);

    Clears SI to move forward.

Line inside case 0x28 (Data transmitted and ACK received)

LPC_I2C->CONCLR = (1<<3);

    Clears SI.

Line inside case 0x10 (Repeated start condition sent)

LPC_I2C->CONCLR = (1<<3) | (1<<5);

    Clears SI and Start condition flag.

Line inside case 0x40 (Slave address + read ACK received)

LPC_I2C->CONCLR = (1<<3) | (1<<2);

    Clears SI and Acknowledge flag (AA).



• Which register is used for reading or writing data?






///////
Here are the answers to the questions based on the provided code:

1. **What line of code would you use to set the Start flag (STA)?**
   Answer: `LPC_I2C->CONSET = (1<<5);`

2. **What line of code would you use to clear the I²C interrupt flag?**
   Answer: `LPC_I2C->CONCLR = (1<<3);`

3. **Which register is used for reading or writing data?**
   Answer: `LPC_I2C->DAT`

4. **The SI flag can be polled to check if an I²C event has occurred. What line of code would you use to wait for an I²C event?**
   Answer: The code uses an interrupt handler (`I2C_Handler`) to handle I²C events, so it doesn't explicitly poll the SI flag. However, if you were to poll the SI flag, you would check the status register and wait for the SI bit to be set. This is typically done in a loop, but the provided code uses interrupts instead of polling.
