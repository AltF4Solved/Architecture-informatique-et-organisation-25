What line of code would you use to clear the I2C interrupt flag?

Lines where SI is cleared:

    Line inside case 0x08 (Start condition sent)

LPC_I2C->CONCLR = (1<<3) | (1<<5);

    Clears SI (1<<3) and Start condition flag (1<<5).

Line inside case 0x18 (Slave address + write ACK received)

LPC_I2C->CONCLR = (1<<3);

    Clears SI to move forward.

Line inside case 0x28 (Data transmitted and ACK received)

LPC_I2C->CONCLR = (1<<3);

    Clears SI.

Line inside case 0x10 (Repeated start condition sent)

LPC_I2C->CONCLR = (1<<3) | (1<<5);

    Clears SI and Start condition flag.

Line inside case 0x40 (Slave address + read ACK received)

LPC_I2C->CONCLR = (1<<3) | (1<<2);

    Clears SI and Acknowledge flag (AA).
